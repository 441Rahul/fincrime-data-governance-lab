# FinCrime Use Case Overview
## Context

Financial institutions are required to identify, monitor, and report potentially suspicious financial activity as part of their anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing obligations.

Despite significant investment in FinCrime platforms, many regulatory failures stem from unclear business rules, fragmented data ownership, and lack of traceability between regulatory expectations, data inputs, and operational decisions.

This use case focuses on retail banking transaction monitoring within a multi-jurisdiction environment.
## Business Objective

The objective of this use case is to:
- Detect potentially suspicious transactions in a timely manner
- Prioritise alerts based on customer and transaction risk
- Enable consistent, auditable decision-making across compliance operations
## Regulatory Drivers

The use case is driven by the following regulatory expectations:
- Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations requiring monitoring and reporting of suspicious activity
- Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements mandating risk-based customer due diligence
- Record retention and auditability obligations imposed by financial regulators

## Key Stakeholders

The successful delivery and operation of this use case involves multiple stakeholders:
- Compliance Operations teams responsible for alert investigation and reporting
- Financial Crime Risk teams defining risk appetite and monitoring strategy
- Technology and Data teams implementing and supporting the monitoring platform
- Regulators and Internal Audit functions providing oversight and assurance
