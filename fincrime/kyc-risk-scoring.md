# KYC Risk Scoring

## Purpose

KYC risk scoring establishes a baseline risk profile for each customer. This risk profile influences the sensitivity of transaction monitoring and determines the level of due diligence applied throughout the customer lifecycle.

## Risk Factors

Customer risk scores are derived from a combination of static and dynamic factors, including:

- Customer geography and residency
- Occupation, industry, and source of funds
- Products and services used
- Transaction volume, frequency, and velocity
- Adverse media or sanctions exposure (where applicable)

## Risk Categories

Based on the assessed risk factors, customers are typically classified into the following categories:

- Low Risk
- Medium Risk
- High Risk

Risk categorisation thresholds and criteria are defined in accordance with the institution’s risk appetite and regulatory expectations.

## Usage of Risk Scores

KYC risk scores are used across multiple FinCrime processes, including:

- Adjusting transaction monitoring thresholds and rule sensitivity
- Prioritising alerts for investigation
- Triggering enhanced due diligence for higher-risk customers
- Supporting regulatory reporting and audit reviews
