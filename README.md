# FinCrime Data Governance Lab

## Problem Statement
Financial institutions invest heavily in AML and FinCrime platforms, yet regulatory failures frequently stem from unclear business rules, weak data governance, and lack of traceability between regulatory obligations, data, and delivery decisions.

- Decision traceability using documentation and Git

## Intended Audience
